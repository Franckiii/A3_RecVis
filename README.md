# A3_RecVis
All my work for the kaggle competition of the course the course [Object Recognition and Computer Vision](https://gulvarol.github.io/teaching/recvis24) aiming at classifying the [ImageNet-Sketch](https://github.com/HaohanWang/ImageNet-Sketch) dataset. 

To launch a model, supposing you have all the libraries installed :

```bash
python ./main.py --data "path/to/sketch_recvis2024/sketch_recvis2024" --model_name "basic_cnn"
```
